# Forecast_Data

This project serves as an introduction to utilizing API's in order to extract and visualize data. Using Jupyter Notebook, the program extracts weather forecast data using a public API from weather.gov. It then formats the data into a table and graph, which act as tools to visualize the hourly forecast data over the following 7 days.
